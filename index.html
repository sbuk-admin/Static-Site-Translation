                <h2>Down the Rabbit Hole</h2>
                <p>
                    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her
                    sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or
                    twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading,
                    but it had no pictures or conversations in it, `and what is
                    the use of a book,' thought Alice `without pictures or
                    conversation?'
                </p>

                <p>
                    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she
                    could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and
                    stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would
                    be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies,
                    when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by
                    her.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice
                    think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say
                    to itself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she
                    thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she
                    ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all
                    seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a
                    watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and
                    then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed
                    across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with
                    either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and
                    burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it,
                    and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large
                    rabbit-hole under the hedge.
